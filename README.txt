# Student Performance Prediction

This machine learning project predicts the academic performance of students based on factors like study time, parental education, internet access, and more. The goal is to identify key indicators that influence student outcomes and provide early insights to improve academic results.

## 📁 Project Structure

- Ml_Student_Performance_Project.ipynb – Main Jupyter Notebook containing EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Overview

The project uses a dataset with student-related features and applies classification algorithms to predict final exam performance (e.g., pass/fail or grades). It emphasizes early intervention for at-risk students based on predictive analysis.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-prediction.git
   ```

2. Change directory:
   ```
   cd student-performance-prediction
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Ml_Student_Performance_Project.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score used for evaluation

## 📌 Results

The model achieved good accuracy in identifying students who are likely to underperform, offering a tool for educators to apply targeted support.
